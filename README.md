# redis-rate-limit
Test rate limiting using redis with bullmq

## Instructions
Start a redis-server on default port 6379. From the `bullmq-redis-test` directory: <br>
`npm i` <br>
`npm run build` <br>
`npm run start` <br>
You should see addition calculation output results from 0 to 5 in between runtime outputs that print every second from a simulated event loop.
